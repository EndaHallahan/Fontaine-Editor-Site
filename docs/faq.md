## Fontaine

### What is a 'manuscript editor'?

'Manuscript editor' is a term we coined to describe a group of word-processors that combine structural and organizational features with traditional text editing features to create programs specifically designed to facilitate complicated writing tasks (bit of a mouthful, isn't it?). Other notable examples include [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview) and fellow open-source project [Manuskript](https://www.theologeek.ch/manuskript/).

### Why should I use Fontaine over _______?

Ultimately it's going to come down to your personal needs and preferences, but we think Fontaine offers a writing experience that's hard to match, a collection of features and options that outshines most of its competition, and the promise of a lot more to come. Also, did we mention that it's free *and* open-source? Steal of a deal right there.

### I like Fontaine. How can I help support it?

You can help support us by donating some of the money you saved back to us. Fontaine may be free software, but that doesn't mean it's free to make and maintain. For more, see [Support Fontaine](/support).

## Open Source

### What is open source software?

Open source software is software that has its source code freely available to view and modify. For more information, see [here](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source). Some open-source projects you may be familiar with include [the GIMP image editor](https://www.gimp.org/), the Linux family of operating systems including [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), the web browser [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), and the engine which runs Google Chrome and now Microsoft Edge, [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/). In fact, if you're reading this on a web browser, chances are you're using open source software as we speak.

### Can I trust open source software?

Yes! While open source software *is* available to be modified by anyone, in almost all open source projects modifications are carefully scrutinized before they are included in the main code base. In many cases, open source software can be considered *safer* for the end user because it is possible to see exactly what it is doing under the hood.

### Is Fontaine open source?

Yes, and proudly! Fontaine is licensed under the GPL-3.0 and can be run, studied, shared, and modified freely. You can find the license itself (and Fontaine's source code) on our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/EndaHallahan/Fontaine-Editor).

## Development

### What is Fontaine made with?

Fontaine is mainly written in Javascript, with a little Rust around the edges. The frontend is built using React and Redux, and the desktop version runs on an Electron backend. We chose to make it this way in order to facilitate cross-platform development and future web integrations. Please don't get mad at us.

### How can I contribute to Fontaine?

Thank you for your interest! You can report issues or contribute to Fontaine itself through our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/EndaHallahan/Fontaine-Editor), or to this website using any of the 'Edit this page' links scattered around, including the one at the bottom of this FAQ.
