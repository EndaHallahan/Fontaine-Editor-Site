## What is this 'Fontaine' thing I've been hearing about?

Fontaine is a special type of word processor that we like to call a 'manuscript editor'. It offers a wealth of organizational and structural features to help you keep large writing projects—whatever they may be—under control and working for you. If you're facing any kind of long writing taks, Fontaine can make your life much, much easier.

For a quick overview of what Fontaine can do for you, take a look at the [Features](features) page. For a more detailed look, check the [Manual](manual).
